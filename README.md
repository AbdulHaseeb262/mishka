Database Admin Access

To access the database admin panel, please provide your email address to me.

Do not share sensitive credentials directly on Fiverr.

Instead, send them inside a password-protected ZIP folder for security reasons.

Mailgun Configuration

For email functionality, you need to configure Mailgun with your own credentials.
Follow these steps:

Obtain a domain â€“ You must have a verified domain to send emails.

Replace the placeholders in the .env file with your actual Mailgun API key, domain, and email address.

Example Configuration:

MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
EMAIL_FROM=your_business_email@example.com
FRONTEND_URL=your_live_website_url

Important: Without a valid Mailgun domain, emails cannot be sent successfully.

Thank you!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
